# Declaration of Independence

# WE THE BOARD OF TROUBS:
Declare independence from the Union of Cherry Creek High School Choirs.
WE stand as one unit.
No longer under the rule of the Oligarchical Controllers known as King C & Mother H.  
## VIVA LA TROUBS
Signed, the officers
 
### Disclaimers
1. The site maintainer does not necessarily agree with this drastic move towards independence, 
but he thought it was funny so he put it up anyway.
2. The officer's signatures were removed for privacy reasons and because the site maintainer can't type cursive.
